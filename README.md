I have implemented a feature-rich application with the following capabilities:

1. **Google Account Authentication:**
   - Users can log in using their Google account.
   
2. **Category Management (CRUD):**
   - A fully functional CRUD system for Categories. If the user is new, default categories are created for them automatically.
   
3. **Gmail Synchronization:**
   - Users can synchronize their Gmail account to fetch emails. A feature is available that allows users to click a button to fetch the first 4 unread emails from their inbox, summarize the content, and categorize them automatically.
   
4. **Email Management:**
   - Users can view, manage, and perform CRUD operations on the fetched emails, offering a seamless email management experience.

5. **Third-Party AI Integration:**
   - Integrated with **Gemini**, **Hugging Face**, and **OpenAI** (using **Gemini** due to limitations with the paid accounts), enabling automatic categorization and summarization of emails.
   
6. **Multi-Account Support:**
   - The application supports multiple Google accounts, allowing users to manage emails from various accounts seamlessly.

7. **Unsubscribing AI Agent (Pending):**
   - I have designed the unsubscribing feature, but it is yet to be implemented due to constraints with the paid services.

8. **Testing:**
   - Comprehensive tests have been written for models, controllers, and services to ensure the application works reliably and as expected.

**Challenges and Constraints:**

- As I currently don’t have a paid Render account, I am unable to host the scheduler for automatic tasks. However, I have already developed the code for it, and it is fully functional in the codebase.
- While the unsubscribing AI agent is designed, it still needs to be implemented. This is the last feature remaining.

**Reflection:**

This has been a challenging and lengthy project, but I’ve put in my best effort to cover all the functionalities and edge cases. I’m unsure if I’ll receive the $3000 reward or secure the job, but I’m eager for feedback on my work, as I’ve dedicated a significant amount of time and effort into creating this application.

**Feedback Request:**

Please let me know your thoughts on the features, code quality, and overall implementation. I’d really appreciate any feedback you can provide to help me improve.
